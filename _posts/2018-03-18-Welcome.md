Hello, I'm <dfn>Seungbin Lee<dfn>.


For the last two years, I have been studying and researching the latest technology from information retrieval to deep neural network.
I joined not only laboratory projects, but also did many external competitions voluntarily and did my best competing with other global IT companies such as Alibaba, Samsung and so on. By working on those projects, 
I have learned and experienced many things and my knowledge about managing massive video feature data and finding meaningful information have been improved a lot during that time.

With an MS degree in Computer Science, I have a full understanding of the project development procedures and the importance of time management and open communication with co-workers. 
I also have experience in machine learning technique, too
* Deep learning framework: *Tensorflow*, *Pytorch*, *Caffe*
* Designing deep neural network model with sequential features

During the time of Bachelor’s degree and Master’s degree in Computer Science, I enjoyed challenging complex problems and I was passionate about developing applications.
I’d like to be a Software engineer who develops the next-generation technologies which change the way of billions of users connecting, exploring, and interacting with information with each other. 


Now, I'm looking for <dfn>Technical Research Personnel</dfn> for military alternative service.
